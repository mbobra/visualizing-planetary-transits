visualizing planetary transits

Every once in a rare while, one of our inner planets transits across the face of the Sun. Over the last few years, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on NASA's [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) has observed both inner planets transit across the Sun.

On May 9, 2016, Mercury [made such a transit](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/mercury-takes-a-stroll-across-the-sun/). The notebook titled `mercury_composite.ipynb` creates the following composite images of Mercury's transit using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory:

On June 6, 2012, Venus transited the face of the Sun. The transit obscured some of the sunlight we observe here on Earth, causing a dip in the brightness of the Sun. People who observe other stars look for a similar signal to indicate the presence of an extrasolar planet. The notebook titled `venus_transit.ipynb` creates images to make a [movie](https://stanford.edu/~mbobra/venus/) of the transit of Venus.
